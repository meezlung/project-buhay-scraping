# buhay-scraper
This repository contains a web scraper developed as part of Project Buhay for our CWTS initiative. The scraper extracts and organizes data essential to Project Buhay's broader goals.

## PhilAtlas Data
This repository includes:
 - **Source Code**: Scripts for web scraping and data processing.
 - **Data Outputs**: Available in both JSON and CSV formats.

Note: I can't seem to find any District Number found in the PhilAtlas website itself, so I had to scrape [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_barangays_in_Quezon_City).

## Rainfall Accumulation Data
Still under development...
